# Welcome to the NOMAD pedestrian dynamics extension documentation

## Concepts

In the concepts section we provide an overview of basic NOMAD concepts:

- An overview of plug-in types: [plugin_types_and_data_processing.md](concepts/plugin_types_and_data_processing.md)
- An introduction to the schema concept: [schemas.md](concepts/schemas.md)

People familiar with NOMAD can skip this section.
